# cs-305-project2
The client Artemis financial a consulting company that provides individual financial plans for customers.
I was hires to help the client modernize operations by utilizing best security measures to protect their current API.
I have to do an vulnerability assesment to determin the best methods to help the client.
The overall dependency check was not difficult to run and implement all the vunlnerabilites showed on the report
and the report itself has documentaion to help understand how to read the report an also helped understand how to 
suppress any false positives that showed on the report that were not reliable or relative to software being used
The most challeging aspects with the dependency report was really only the first time using the check as it
took extremely long time to run and to find the report the first time but through practice and repetition 
this was not an issue.
The decision for this client was to use Advanced Encryption standard (AES) with SHA(256) Hash function alogorithm
as this seemed best measures to protect against attacker trying to gain access to sensitive customer information.
I have run into a massive hurdle with implementing the code and run a check sum verification for the hash 
code freezes while trying to run once it connects to the server and there no indication of errors and through
research to work through this as of yet I have no come to a remedy.
I was able to use the keytool to create certificates and convert files to necessary files for eclipse to read.
overall still need to work on this project and correct problems and produce a working hash that I can validate.
